This side project log covers work done from 3/20/2023 - 3/27/2023

## SEPTA Site

I started a new project that aimed to recreate parts of SEPTA's website with a more elegant UI, and using
SEPTA's new "SEPTA Metro" wayfinding. The main goal with this project was to help me learn Svelte. I also had 
to reverse-engineer the APIs on septakey.org in order to authenticate a user and get their trip history. 

In terms of Svelte, I really enjoyed working with it and overall I found it much more elegant and easier to work
with than React. I didn't like the way it handled client-server interaction with its serverside functions. 

I have not made this open source yet and do not intend to until it's more polished.

## [Verified Bot](https://github.com/benaubin/verified-bot)

I made all the necessary changes and tests to get VerifiedBot working. It is now waiting on my friend Ben 
to merge my PR with the changes outlined in my [spring break blog](https://nickorlow.com/blog/spring-break-2023).


## [Mahantongo](https://github.com/nickorlow/mahantongo)

I created some QoL features, such as using Discord's embeds instead of sending regular text messages, showing which board 
a post was on, and fixing some bugs.
