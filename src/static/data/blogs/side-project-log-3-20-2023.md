Spring break just wrapped up. I wrote a [blog]() last week about the side projects that I was planning on 
doing. I wanted to provide an update on what I got done, and figured I'd turn it into a recurring thing.

This side project log covers work done from 3/13/2023 - 3/20/2023

## Personal Website Facelift

I managed to move my website over to tab-based navigation pretty early on in the break. It just involved setting
up a navbar component and then using react-navigation to navigate between pages. I also managed to 
update my projects page to be more compact and readable. 

There is still work to be done on making it look better, but I mostly believe that
it's just going to be somewhat minor tweaks.

## Mahantongo

I managed to finish this one. I learned a lot about Rust and I've gained an appreciation for
Rust's enforcement of good programming habits, and I really like how error handling is done.


Working with Serenity was pretty easy as it mirrored some of the other Discord SDKs I've used
before.
